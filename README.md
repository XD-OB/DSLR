# DSLR (Datascience X Logistic Regression)
### Harry Potter and a Data Scientist

On no! Since its creation, the famous school of wizards, Hogwarts, had never known such an offense. The forces of evil have bewitched the Sorting Hat.
It no longer responds, and is unable to fulfill his role of sorting the students to the houses.

The new academic year is approaching. Gladly, the Professor McGonagall was able to take action in such a stressful situation, since it is impossible for Hogwarts not to welcome new students. . . She decided to call on you, a muggle "datascientist" who is able to create miracles with the tool which all muggles know how to use: a "computer".
Despite the intrinsic reluctance of many wizards, the director of the school welcomes you to his office to explain the situation. You are here because his informant discovered
that you are able to recreate a magic Sorting Hat using your muggle tools.

You explain to him that in order for your "muggle" tools to work, you need students data. Hesitantly, Professor McGonagall gives you a dusty spellbook. Fortunately for you, a simple "Digitalis!" and the book turned into a USB stick.
